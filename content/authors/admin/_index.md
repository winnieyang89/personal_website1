I am a PhD candidate in Sociology at McGill University, with a Graduate Option in Gender and Women's Studies. Before starting my journey as a PhD student in Montreal, I received an MSc in Sociology from the University of Oxford, and a BA in the Interdisciplinary Program of Humanities and Social Sciences from National Tsing Hua University. 

My research is organized around three areas of inquiry: marriage and family dynamics; cultural and meaning-making processes; and social mobility within and across generational lines. In each of these areas, I pay particular attention to how sex, gender and sexuality intersect with other axes of social inequality. To this end, I conduct both quantitative and qualitative research based on various types of data, including censuses, administrative tax records, surveys, and interviews. 

Thus far, my work has appeared--or is forthcoming--in *Journal of Marriage and Family*, *Demographic Research* and the *Journal of Population Research* and has been generously funded by the Department of Women and Gender Equality (Canada), the Canadian Research Data Centre Network, the Government of Taiwan, among other funding agencies.
